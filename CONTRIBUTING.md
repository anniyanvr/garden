# Developing the Garden CLI framework

## Contributing guidelines

We heartily welcome any form of contribution to the project, including issue reports, feature requests,
discussion, pull requests and any type of feedback. We request that all contributors
adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and work with us to make the collaboration and
community productive and fun for everyone :)

## Commit messages

We follow and automatically validate
[Angular-like formatting](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#commits) for our
commit messages, for consistency and clarity. In particular, the **type** of the commit header must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing
  semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation
  generation

When generating the changelog, we only include the following types: **feat**, **fix**, **refactor**, and **perf**. This means that any changes that the user should be aware of, should have one of these types.

## Setting up your development environment

Start by cloning the repo.

For Mac we have a script that installs all required dependencies, mostly via Homebrew:

    ./bin/bootstrap-osx

Other platforms need to roll their own for now (contributions welcome!). Please have a look
at the script for Mac to see what's installed. Once dependencies are in place, all you need is:

    npm install
    lerna bootstrap

## Running a development version of the CLI

While developing the CLI, we recommend you run the dev command in your console:

    cd garden-service
    npm run dev

This will do an initial development build, `npm link` it to your global npm folder, and then watch for
changes and auto-rebuild as you code. You can then run the `garden` command as normal.

Also, you might like to add a couple of shorthands:

    alias g='garden'
    alias k='kubectl'

## Testing

Tests are run using `mocha`. To run the full test suite, including linting and other validation, simply run
from the root:

    npm test

### CI

We use [Circle CI](https://circleci.com) for integration testing. Sometimes
it can be useful to test and debug the CI build locally, particularly when
updating or adding dependencies. You can use their
[CLI](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-jobs/) for that, which
is installed automatically by the `./bin/bootstrap-osx` script. Once you
have it installed you can run `circleci build` in the repo root to test
the build locally.

## License/copyright headers

Every source file must include the contents of `static/license-header.txt` at the top. This is
automatically checked during CI. You can run the check with `npm run check-licenses`.

## Release process

Our release process generates the following packages:

* An executable for OSX, Linux, and Windows, generated by [Pkg](https://github.com/zeit/pkg) and hosted on our [Github page](https://github.com/garden-io/garden/releases).
* A [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package for OSX users.

To make a new release, set your current working directory to the garden root directory and follow the steps below. The examples assume we're creating a release for `0.8.0-rc2`:

1. Checkout out to a new release branch: `git checkout -b release-0.8.0-rc2`.
2. Run the release script: `./bin/release 0.8.0-rc2`. This will update the version, generate the changelog, create a tag for the version, and push the tag to Github. Pushing the tag triggers a CI process which creates the release artifacts.
3. Open the [Garden project on CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/garden-io/garden) and browse to the job marked `release-service-pkg`. Open the **Artifacts** tab and download the listed artifacts.
4. Go to our Github [Releases tab](https://github.com/garden-io/garden/releases) and click the **Draft a new release** button.
5. Fill in the **Tag version** and **Release title** fields with the new release version (same as you used for the tag).
6. Upload the downloaded artifacts.
7. Write release notes (not necessary for RCs). The notes should _at least_ contain the changelog.
8. Click the **Publish release** button.
9. Push the branch and make a pull request.
10. If you're making an RC, you're done! Otherwise, you need to update Homebrew package: `gulp update-brew`.
